/**
 * Implementations of this interface are responsible for all the caching needs of Depot.
 *
 * From the point of view of this interface, there are a potentially very large number of
 * caches available, each idenfided by a unique cacheId. Currently Depot creates up to three
 * caches for each record type:
 *
 * Any record type with a primary key has a {@link CacheCategory#RECORD} cache, for storing
 * record instances by primary key.
 *
 * Record types with primary keys may also have a {@link CacheCategory#KEYSET} cache wherein
 * {@link KeySet} instances are stored, identified by query strings. See {@link FindAllQuery}
 * for more on this.
 *
 * Finally, clients may request {@link CacheCategory#RESULT} caching of entire result sets of
 * some record type -- which does not need to have a primary key, in contrast to the other two
 * categories. These are also identified by query strings, and end up in a third cache.
