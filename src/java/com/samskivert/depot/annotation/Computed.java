     * The purpose of shadowing is largely to avoid having to supply a {@link FieldOverride} when
     * querying for objects that that contain large subsets of some other persistent object's
     * fields -- in other words, when you use a computed entity to query only some of the columns
     * from a table.
     *
     * The shadowed class must have been brought into the query using e.g. {@link FromOverride}
     * or {@link Join} clauses. The referenced fields must be simple concrete columns in a table;
     * they must themselves be computed or overridden or shadowing.
     *
     * TODO: Do in fact let the shadowed field be computed, overriden or shadowing.
